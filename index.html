    <h1>My Experience with The Bicycle Studio of Wake Forest / Giant Wake Forest</h1>

    <p>On 2/18/2025, I purchased a Giant brand bike from The Bicycle Studio from the owner, Adam Brooke.
        I chose them because I had recalled them being a Giant rep. The bike cost $2,664.09.
    </p>

    <p>I followed up once or twice a week for nearly two months. Each time, there was a new excuse: first the bike was
        delayed, then it had a bad wheel requiring a warranty claim, then it supposedly never arrived, and finally I was
        offered a replacement bike already in shipment.</p>

    <p>On 3/19, I confirmed in person that I would accept a replacement Scott brand bike.</p>

    <p>On 4/1, Adam Brooke said the bike would be ready on 4/2. After 4/2, Adam Brooke stopped responding to texts. </p>

    <p>I visited the shop, and on 4/3 he said it was the "next bike to assemble," but it was the end of the day.</p>

    <p>On 4/8, when I visited again, Adam Brooke claimed the wrong bike had been shipped. He said he would issue a
        refund. I
        saw the refund appear in my banking app and left the store.</p>

    <p>However, a couple days later, I discovered that the refund was reversed, and I am still out the money for the
        bike I never
        received. I now have to involve my bank.</p>
