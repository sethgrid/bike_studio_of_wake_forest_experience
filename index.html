    <h1>My Experience with The Bicycle Shop / Giant Wake Forest</h1>

    <p>On 2/18, I purchased a Giant brand bike from The Bicycle Shop / Giant Wake Forest, from the owner, Adam Brooke.
    </p>

    <p>I followed up once or twice a week for nearly two months. Each time, there was a new excuse: first the bike was
        delayed, then it had a bad wheel requiring a warranty claim, then it supposedly never arrived, and finally I was
        offered a replacement bike already in shipment.</p>

    <p>On 3/19, I confirmed in person that I would accept a replacement Scott brand bike.</p>

    <p>On 4/1, Adam said the bike would be ready on 4/2. (See attached text thread screenshots.)</p>

    <p>After 4/2, Adam stopped responding to texts. I visited the shop two more times, and on 4/3 he said it was the
        "next bike to assemble."</p>

    <p>On 4/8, when I visited again, Adam claimed the wrong bike had been shipped. He said he would issue a refund. I
        saw the refund appear in my banking app and left the store.</p>

    <p>However, today I discovered that the refund was reversed, and I am still out the money for the bike I never
        received.</p>
